### Examples
##### write a program to count the number of strictly positive integers in an array

```c 
// C implimentation
ptr = LIST;
positive = 0;
counter = 0;

while(counter < SIZE){ // one "brance system"
	if(*ptr++ > 0){ // "another branch system"
		positive++;
	}
	counter++;
}
*ptr = positive
```

- so the if statement can become into a [[CMP (compare)]] branch (note for later make seprate documents for each command)
- `*ptr++` is +(An)  <- which addressing mode is this using

still needs to be looked into
