the difference between this and BRA, is how they handle the PC, JMP can go anywhere in the memory (i am still trying to figure out how since where does it store the memory address)

so its basically it legit just changes the value of the PC. it doesn't offset it. none of that just changes the value of the PC

tbh there is nothing more to this
